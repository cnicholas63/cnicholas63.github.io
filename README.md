# Portfolio

## Current work
Currently employed on a research project called *Adaptive User Interfaces*, studying interaction behaviour when the user is engaged with an eye tracker for text entry. I have been responsible for the development of an eye tracker controlled keyboard, developed using C#, Visual Studio and the Tobii API. Along with the keyboard, I've been using R and RStudio for the analysis and presentation of data captured. 

Prior to my current role, I spent four years studying toward an integrated Master's degree in Software Application Development. 

This page introduces and provides links to a few of my GitHub repos produced during this time.
