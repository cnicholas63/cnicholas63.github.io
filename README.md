Currently employed as a Research Assistant
I have been working on a project called Adaptive User Interfaces that is studying behavior when users are using an eye tracker for text entry. As part of my role I have responsibility for the deveopment of an eye tracker controlled keyboard. I have developed this using C# and the Tobii API. Whilst I am allowed to provide an overview of the project, unfortunately, I am not allowed to share the code.
Along with the keyboard - which records a lot of information when running experiments, I have been using R (which was new to me) to develop functionality for the analysis and presentation of the data. This project has been a lot of fun and very informative.

Previous to my current role, I spent four years studying for a Master's degree in Software Application Development. This page introduces and provides links to my GitHub repos for some of the projects I have worked on during this time.
